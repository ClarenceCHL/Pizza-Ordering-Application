# Pizza-Ordering-Application
The goal of this project is to write an application, which runs on the Graphical User Interface, that functions as a complete pizza ordering system. Namely, the system includes pizza type selection, topping selection, and size selection. Different types of pizza have different default flavors and also have different prices. Users can choose as many pizza as they want. A check-out stage is also included in the application as the second stage interface. For more detail information about this application, please refer to README.md. I hope you like the project and please feel free to fork:)
