# Pizza-Ordering-Application
JavaFX SDK Version: JavaFX-SDK-11.0.2 (Couldn't upload the sdk folder due to the file size limitation on GitHub, please download the sdk from google)

The goal of this project is to write an application, which runs on the Graphical User Interface, that functions as a complete pizza ordering system. Namely, the system includes pizza type selection, topping selection, and size selection.

Pizza Types:

Deluxe: Small 14$, Medium 16$, Large 18$.

Hawaiian: Small 8$, Medium 10$, large 12$.

Build Your Own: Small 5$, Medium 7$, Large 9$. (+2$ / each added topping)

NOTE: 

1. The detailed toppings are in the program.

2. Deluxe and Hawaiian have default toppings and cannot be added or removed. 

3. Build You Own pizza can choose up to 6 toppings from the topping list with minimum 1 topping required.

Different types of pizza have different default flavors and also have different prices.

Users can choose as many pizza as they want.

A check-out interface is also included in the application as the second stage interface, which contains the running total of all pizza orders.
